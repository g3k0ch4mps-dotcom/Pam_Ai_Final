## 7. Strategic Advice for Toronto Market

1.  **Emphasize "Time Zone Overlap":**
    *   Kenya (EAT) is often 7-8 hours ahead of Toronto (EST).
    *   **Pitch:** "I work while you sleep. You send requests in your evening, and they are done by your morning."
    *   **Pitch:** "I work while you sleep. You send requests in your evening, and they are done by your morning."
    *   Or: "I can overlap 2-3 hours of your morning for synchronous meetings."

2.  **Highlight Communication:**
    *   Toronto clients value clear, direct English communication. Your documentation quality proves this.
    *   Mention your "System Documentation" deliverable as a key selling point.

3.  **The "AI Specialist" Premium:**
    *   Don't just sell "web development." Sell "AI Transformation."
    *   Regular devs charge $60/hr. AI experts charge $100+/hr.

## 8. Negotiation Tips

*   **If they say "Too expensive":**
    *   "I understand. We can look at the **Essential** package which gets you to market for $28k, and add features later." (Don't lower rate, reduce scope).
*   **If they compare to cheap freelancers ($20/hr):**
    *   "You can certainly find cheaper developers. However, my rate includes architectural security, comprehensive documentation (so you aren't locked in), and AI expertise that ensures the chatbot actually works."
