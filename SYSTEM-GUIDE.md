## 🌓 Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Knowledge Base
Stop letting your data sit idle in folders. Our system ingests:
- **Files**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, and Markdown.
- **Websites**: Just provide a URL, and our ultra-smart scraper extracts the content while filtering out the noise.
- **Auto-Update**: Keep your knowledge fresh with scheduled website rescans.

### 2. Smart RAG Chat
Unlike standard AI, our "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG) ensures the AI **only** answers based on **your** data. No hallucinations, just facts about your products, prices, and policies.

### 3. Lead Capture & Engagement
Every chat is an opportunity. The system automatically:
- Identifies customer interests.
- Captures names, emails, and phone numbers during the conversation.
- Scores leads based on their engagement level.
- Exports leads to CSV for your marketing team.
